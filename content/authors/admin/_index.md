I'm a Data Scientist currently working at the Dartmouth Antibody Lab at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. I've written practice content for gradient boosted trees and introductory data analysis, and have a particular interest in reproducable research, model interpretability, and positive social impact through the careful and ethical use of modern data techniques.

In my previous professional life, I was an opera singer and nonprofit fundraiser. I live in Lebanon, NH with my fianc√©e, Jenn, and our nine plants: Barb, Hermie, Isabella, Lillian, Pete, Picasso, Sebastian, Stefan, and Vinny.
